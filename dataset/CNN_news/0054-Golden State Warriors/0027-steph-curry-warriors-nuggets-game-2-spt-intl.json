  "After missing a month of action with a foot injury, Curry has come off the bench in the opening two games of the series as he looks to work his way back to full fitness.",
  "After scoring 16 points in Game 1, Curry really upped the ante on Monday, shooting 12-for-17 (71%) from the field – including five three pointers – the highest field goal percentage of his playoff career.",
  "”The first half a little pep in my step and the body felt good, I was able to kind of get to some spots,” Curry told the media afterwards.",
  "”When you make certain shots it feels a little different, it feels a little bit more normal and more emotion kind of comes out, especially with that layoff, so it was a nice feeling.”",
  "Warriors head coach Steve Kerr seems to have found his five-man lineup for the clutch portion of games, and used it masterfully in the win over the Nuggets on Monday.",
  "Made up of the Warriors’ three explosive guards – Curry, Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole – as well as Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, the lineup gave Golden State a lift just when they needed it.",
  "After a sluggish start, the five were assembled with just over five minutes left of the second quarter with the Warriors trailing by eight. By halftime, they were leading by six.",
  "That push gave the team the momentum to run away with the game, eventually winning by a 20-point margin and taking a commanding lead in their playoff series.",
  "Poole continued his breakout season, scoring 29 points, while Thompson added 21 points.",
  "But it was Green’s stifling defense on the NBA’s reigning MVP Nikola Jokic which really proved the difference maker.",

  "The 6 foot 11 inch Serbian played on the edge all night, reacting strongly when Gary Payton II patted Jokic on the backside, having to be held back by Curry and Poole as he tried to make his way to the Warriors guard.",
