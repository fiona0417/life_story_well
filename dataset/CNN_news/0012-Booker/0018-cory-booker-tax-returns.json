  "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey released 10 years of tax returns Wednesday, becoming the latest Democratic presidential candidate to take this step as President Donald Trump continues to keep his own finances out of public view.",
  "Booker had an adjusted gross income of $152,715 last year and paid $22,781 in federal taxes — a rate of roughly 19%. He reported giving $24,000 to charity in 2018, or around 16% of his income; in all, Booker donated around $460,000 over 10 years.",
  "Many of Booker’s rivals in the 2020 race have already disclosed their tax returns, including Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and they have urged Trump to do the same.",
  "Sanders revealed in his returns that he is firmly among the 1% — bringing in with his wife more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017, and $561,293 last year.",
  "O’Rourke has come under scrutiny for his anemic donations to charity, which totaled just $1,667 in 2017, or 0.3% of his income. Defending that level of giving, O’Rourke recently said he did not itemize all of his donations.",
  "Although Booker earned income only from his Senate salary in 2018, he has experienced more lucrative periods in the past. He reported royalties of $311,650 in 2016 and $400,177 in 2015 around the release of his memoir, “United.” And Booker brought in more than $1.7 million from public speaking from 2009 through 2013 when he was Newark mayor."
