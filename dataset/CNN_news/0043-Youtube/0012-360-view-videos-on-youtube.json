  "Unfortunately, for the time being, you can only control 360-degree videos through the YouTube Android app, or in a Chrome browser.",
  "On Chrome, use the navigation wheel at the top left corner of a video, and drag your mouse around to get the view you want.",
  "YouTube Android app users can simply move and tilt their smartphones or tablets at different angles, moving these devices closer to becoming virtual reality consoles.",

  "In a blog post, Google says only four cameras are currently compatible with YouTube's new feature: The Giroptic 360cam, Ricoh Theta, IC Real Tech Allie, and Kodak SP360.",
  "Each device records footage through multiple wide-angle lenses. Software then blends the images together to achieve the final spherical views.",
  "There's only a trickle of 360-degree videos on YouTube right now, compared to the more than 300 hours of traditional video content uploaded every minute."
