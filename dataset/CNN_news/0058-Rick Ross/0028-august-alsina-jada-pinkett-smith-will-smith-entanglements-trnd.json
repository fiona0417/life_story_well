  "The couple was “going through a very difficult time,” according to Pinkett Smith, and had broken up when Pinkett Smith started a romantic relationship with the 27-year-old singer.",
  "In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved in a romantic relationship with Pinkett Smith, who has been married to Smith since 1997.",
  "“I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,” Alsina said during the interview. “Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.”",
  "Alsina also recently released an album called “The Product III: stateofEMERGEncy.”"
