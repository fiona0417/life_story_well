  "Two Southern California men pleaded not guilty Friday to all charges in the severe beating of San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow after a Los Angeles Dodgers game last year, a prosecutor’s spokeswoman said.",
  "Marvin Norwood, 31, and Louie Sanchez, 30, both of Rialto, California, are each charged with mayhem, assault and battery, and all three charges are felonies, according to court papers.",
  "Sanchez is also charged with special allegations of great bodily injury in the assault and battery counts, said spokeswoman Jane Robison of the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.",
  "Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the March 31, 2011, beating in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium after a game with the Giants. He is recovering from a brain injury, and last month, his family’s website said Stow “still doesn’t understand or realize what has happened.”",
  "Sanchez also pleaded not guilty Friday to two misdemeanor counts – one for battery and the other for assault – against one person inside the ballpark and another person in the parking lot on the same day, Robison said.",
  "Sanchez and Norwood are to return to Los Angeles County Superior Court on July 24."
