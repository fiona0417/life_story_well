  "The Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is known mostly for his statements on the field, such as his 36 completions thrown Thursday night against the Chicago Bears, which shattered a team record.",
  "But it was at his postgame press conference where Rodgers, 32, made his strongest statement of all.",
  "The quarterback took the podium and faced the press wearing the knit lambswool sweater made famous by Jeff Bridges’ character The Dude in the 1998 cult-favorite “The Big Lebowski.”",
  "Rodgers said nothing about his tan and grey zip-up, but when reached by an ESPN reporter by text message late Thursday night, he said simply, “The Dude abides” — a phrase oft-repeated in the film.",
  "The sweater, a version of which was proudly recreated and is sold by Pendleton as “The Original Westerley,” can be owned for a cool $239 (plus shipping).",
  "Happy customers there describe it as high-quality, warm, roomy and comfortable. One reviewer, who says he’s from Wisconsin and has a “muscular” body type, wrote simply, “The sweater abides. Quality you can see and feel. Classics never go out of style.”"
