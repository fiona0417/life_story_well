  "Actress Olivia Munn has shot down a published report that she’s engaged to boyfriend Aaron Rodgers, quarterback for the Green Bay Packers.",
  "And she did it in the most personal way: by posting to Instagram a conversation over text messaging with her mom.",
  "Munn’s mother: “Hey why don’t you tell me first?”",
  "Munn: “Oh my gosh Mom no. You know you shouldn’t believe gossip on the internet. If I was engaged, I promise you’d be like the 8th person to know. Maybe 9th. But definitely way before the internet.”",
  "The rumor apparently surfaced in a story on the OK! Magazine website. An unnamed source reported that Rodgers proposed over a romantic dinner and that the couple planned to marry in his hometown of Chico, California.",
  "In posting to Instagram, Munn explained that she didn’t want “to have to answer the same question over and over again” as she does a press tour for “Ride Along 2:” “So instead, I’m going to let my text conversation with my Asian mom help me out.”",
  "Munn has gone to social media before to address her relationship with Rodgers.",
  "In November, an ESPN writer listed five reasons Rodgers was struggling this season, with one reason being the distraction of dating a famous actress like Munn, who  appeared on “The Daily Show” as a correspondent and co-starred in HBO’s “The Newsroom.”",
  "Munn turned to Twitter to take a shot at the writer, saying: “Playing it fast & loose w/the journalism @RobDemovsky. Your professional skills are lacking… you must be having personal problems at home.”",
  "Rodgers’ skills are shining these days. He led the Packers to victory in an NFL playoff game last weekend against the Washington Redskins. The Packers will play the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday."
