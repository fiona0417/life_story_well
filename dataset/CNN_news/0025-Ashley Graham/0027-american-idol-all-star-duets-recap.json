  "“American Idol” brought out several A-list musicians for an epic night of duets on Monday night’s episode.",
  "The top 20 were divided into two groups and they teamed up with some of the biggest names in music such as Pat Benatar, Jason Mraz, Shaggy, Elle King, Julia Michaels, Ben Harper and Brett Young.",
  "Riley Thompson teamed up with Brett Young to sing “Like I Loved You,” and proved why she deserved to move forward to the next round.",
  "Madison VanDenburg gave us all the feels when she sang “We Belong” with music legends Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo.",
  "And who wasn’t loving Jeremiah Lloyd Harmon’s rendition of Cindy Lauper’s “Time After Time” with Cynthia Erivo?",
  "Last but not least, Evelyn Cormier teamed up with Chris Isaak to sing “Wicked Game” – which was fitting, since it was the song Cormier sang during her audition.",
  "But not everyone was able to advance, only 14 made it to the next round. Along with the performers above, Alejandro Aranda, Alyssa Raghu, Ashley Hess, Dimitrius Graham, Eddie Island, Laci Kaye Booth, Laine Hardy, Uché, Wade Cota and Walker Burroughs all made the cut."
