  "Sports Illustrated is making history with a trio of beauties.",
  "The revered magazine released its new cover for this year’s swimsuit edition. Make that three covers – a first for the magazine in decades.",
  "“For the first time in 52 years, there will be three different SI swimsuit covers,” Sports Illustrated said in announcing this year’s decision to feature Ronda Rousey, Hailey Clauson and Ashley Graham.",
  "Graham, who is size 16,  is considered plus-sized, which the magazine addressed on its website.",
  "“All three women are beautiful, sexy and strong. Beauty is not cookie cutter. Beauty is not ‘one size fits all,’” assistant managing editor MJ Day said.",
  "Graham, 28, has her own line of lingerie and is a founder of a group for larger models. Day described her confidence as contagious.",
  "“She owns her sexiness in a way that every woman should,” Day said.",
  "Fashion model Clauson, 20, is right at home on the cover. She has worked with major brands such as Gucci, and is described as the epitome of cool.",
  "“Hailey is the cool girl who doesn’t even know how cool she really is,” Day said.  “She’s not only every man’s dream but also every woman’s ‘girl crush.’ She’s goofy. She’s smart. And she’s completely humble.”",
  "Then there’s mixed martial artist Rousey, who makes a fiery but sultry appearance. She adds cover model to a long list of accolades that includes actress and judoka",
  "“Ronda Rousey is a cultural phenomenon,” Day said. “She is the perfect combination of beauty, brains, brawn and humility. She possesses a spirit bigger than the space around her.”",
  "The swimsuit issue hits newsstands Monday."
