  "Who knew the Florida Gators versus the Louisiana State University Tigers would prove to be such a hot ticket?",
  "Tom Cruise, who famously played a sports agent in “Jerry Maguire,” added a little extra star power on Saturday night when he attended the game in Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge. The actor is reportedly filming in New Orleans and decided to take in some college football action.",
  "Scott Rabalais, sports columnist for The Advocate in Baton Rouge, tweeted a picture of Cruise applauding an LSU touchdown while in the booth of LSU’s athletic director, Joe Alleva.",
  "Rabalais also tweeted that Alleva told him it was Cruise’s first college football game.",
  "Of course having a mega movie star in the house pretty much made Twitter’s day, with lots of folks tweeting the news.",
  "But the winning tweet proved to be from The Advocate sports writer Ross Dellenger, who tweeted that Cruise told him – over the urinal – that the game was “Memorable. Exciting. Everything else will pale in comparison.”",
  "Cruise proved to be a good luck charm for the Tigers as they won with a final score of 35-28."
