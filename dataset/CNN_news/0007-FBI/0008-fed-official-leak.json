  "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are looking into an Internet post made this week that claims to have revealed the home addresses of current and former top CIA, FBI and DHS officials.",
  "An unidentified person -- or group -- uploaded the list to Pastebin.com, a website that allows for anonymous posts.",
  "The page lists physical addresses or phone numbers. The post says they belong to current agency leaders, such as FBI Director James Comey and DHS Director Charles Johnson, as well as several former officials, including CIA and DHS directors.",
  "It also claims to reveal more potentially sensitive information. There are P.O. boxes allegedly used by the the CIA as cover addresses. And there's contact information supposedly belonging to the chief of the CIA's National Counterterrorism Center -- the man who started the CIA's drone operations and was depicted in the film Zero Dark Thirty as \"The Wolf.\"",
  "CNN cannot confirm that any of this information is correct.",
  "The post does not indicate anyone claiming responsibility for the hack. However, the message is laden with conspiracy theorist talk about a \"New World Order\" and the existence of Nazi-like concentration camps maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
  "\"Let these evil NWO satanists know that there will be hell to pay for their 911 treason, and their future FEMA camp planned public crackdown treason also,\" the message reads. \"Jesus is Lord, and the public is in charge, not these satanic NWO stooges!!!\""
