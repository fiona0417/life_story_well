  "President Barack Obama was caught crooning again – this time to R&B singer Usher, who received warm birthday wishes at the White House from the President and the first lady.",
  "Usher was at the White House to perform for the first family on his birthday, Oct. 14, in honor of the National Endowment for the Humanities 50th anniversary when he was surprised with a birthday song.",
  "In a video published to Usher’s Facebook account on Oct. 17, the singer appears surprised when a cupcake with a candle is brought out for him and the Obamas begin to sing “Happy birthday.”",
  "“I couldn’t be more grateful for this moment and all of the birthday wishes from everyone,” Usher writes, who was turning 37.",
  "This isn’t the first time the President has broken out in song recently. In August, Obama was in New Orleans for the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and started singing after a woman he met told him her name was Weezy, which reminded him of the show “The Jeffersons.”",
  "Perhaps most memorably, Obama sang “Amazing Grace” while eulogizing Clementa C. Pinckney, a pastor who was killed in the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting in June."
