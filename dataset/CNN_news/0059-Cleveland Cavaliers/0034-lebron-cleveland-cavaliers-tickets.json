  "Meanwhile, ticket prices for Wednesday's opener of the team he left, the Miami Heat, ended up being ice cold.",

  "The average price for the team's home opener stood at $987 Thursday afternoon, up from a mere $56 a year ago, according to StubHub. Tickets on the search engine SeatGeek are lower, averaging at about $725, but that's still no bargain.",
  "Meanwhile, seats at the Miami Heat's opener Wednesday went for an average of just $84, down more than 70% from a year ago, when the team was the defending its NBA championship.",
  "Prices for the Cavs' entire season have jumped also, up 67% from last year to an average of $166, according to StubHub.",
  "Thursday's game is by far the most expensive Cleveland event in recent memory. The playoff game for the Cleveland Indians last year went for an average of $146 on StubHub, while the Cavaliers' last playoff game in 2010 went for an about $242.",
  "Fans paid about $111 to see the Cleveland Browns' home opener this year, even though there was great excitement after the team drafted quarterback Johnny Manziel."
