  "Die-hard Green Bay Packers fan Rep. Paul Ryan watched his team oust the Dallas Cowboys from the NFL playoffs Sunday – and then he trolled the most famous Cowboys fan joining him on the list of 2016 GOP presidential contenders.",
  "In a tweet directed at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ryan asked, “do you need a hug now?”",
  "Ryan was mocking Christie because, while attending the Cowboys’ playoff victory over the Detroit Lions, he was so excited by the victory that he awkwardly hugged the equally thrilled team owner, Jerry Jones.",
  "The Wisconsin Republican wasn’t the only one taunting Christie on Sunday.",
  "Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers had a clever name for an audible he called at the line of scrimmage on his team’s first drive Sunday: “New York Bozo! New York Bozo!”",
  "Sure, Christie’s from New Jersey – but it was close enough to leave little doubt what he meant."
