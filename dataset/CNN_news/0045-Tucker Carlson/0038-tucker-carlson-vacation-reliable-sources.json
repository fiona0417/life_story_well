  "Carlson then listed other problems facing America, such as a “fading middle class” and the national debt. Carlson added, “This is not a white supremacist country plotting the slaughter of its own people. It’s a kind country full of decent people of all races who like all people everywhere make bad decisions from time to time. But they mean well and they generally try their best.”"
