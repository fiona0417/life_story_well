  "On Monday, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert (R) called Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar (D) to, ostensibly, apologize for suggesting that simply because Omar is a Muslim, she is a potential terrorist.",
  "The call, um, did not go well. After Omar demanded that Boebert apologize publicly and Boebert refused, the Democrat hung up on the Republican.",
  "At which point, Boebert took to social media (of course!) to make clear she wasn’t actually sorry.",
  "“I will fearlessly continue to put America first, never sympathizing with terrorists,” Boebert said in the post. “Unfortunately Ilhan can’t say the same thing and our country is worse off for it.”",
  "Then came new reporting Tuesday from CNN’s KFile on a speech Boebert gave in September in which she suggested that Omar was a terrorist in addition to being “black-hearted” and “evil.”",
  "Add it up and you get this: Not only is Boebert not sorry for what she said about Omar but she actually believes it. This wasn’t some slip of the tongue for Boebert; it was a real belief.",
  "All of which raises a simple question: What are House Republicans going to do about it?",
  "If past is prologue, the answer is nothing. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has resisted punishing the likes of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar for past impolitic comments, leaving it to the Democratic-controlled House to sanction them.",
  "Considering that, the real decision may lie in Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s hands.  Does she want to hold another vote to penalize another Republican for making offensive comments? And if not, why not?",
  "The Point: Unfortunately, the Republican base responds in a positive way to junk like this from Boebert. Which means she is incentivized to lean into it – no matter the consequences in the House."
