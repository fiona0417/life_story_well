  "Even the haters have got to love Beyonce.",
  "The singer is very cleverly selling \"Boycott Beyonce\" merchandise on her Formation tour. It's a tongue-in-cheek reference to an earlier controversy over her Super Bowl performance and \"Formation\" music video.",
  "In February Beyonce dropped the music video for her single \"Formation,\" and it included a reference to the Black Lives Matters movement. She followed that by including backup dancers dressed in Black Panther-esque outfits during her Super Bowl halftime show.",
  "Some police unions viewed the show as being anti-police and asked their members not to provide off-duty security for her stadium tour.",
  "But the singer told Elle magazine recently, \"anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken.\"",
  "\"I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,\" she said.",
  "\"But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me.\"",
  "Beyonce kicked off her Formation tour Wednesday night in Miami."
