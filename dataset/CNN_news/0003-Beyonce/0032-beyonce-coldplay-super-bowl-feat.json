  "Let’s hope the lights stay on this time.",
  "Pepsi confirmed to “Entertainment Tonight” that Beyonce will join Coldplay for next month’s Super Bowl 50 halftime show, sponsored by the drink brand. “ET” reports that the singer will presumably join the group for a rendition of its single “Hymn for the Weekend,” which features her vocals.",
  "Representatives for Beyonce and Coldplay did not respond to a request for comment.",
  "Beyonce was the featured performer at the halftime show in New Orleans in 2013. After her electrifying performance of such hits as “Single Ladies” and “Crazy in Love” as well as a brief reunion with members of Destiny’s Child, half the lights at the Superdome suddenly went out.",
  "Coldplay frontman Chris Martin is pals with Beyonce and her husband, rapper Jay Z.",
  "He recently joked with late-night talk show host James Corden about what it’s like to work with the superstars.",
  "“You get summoned to their castle, then you wait for about a week in a small room, where you’re just fed very minimally,” Martin said. “And if you survive that … whoever survives that, you get through to the next stage, where you get to play tennis with Jay. And if you beat him twice, you get sent through to meet the rest of Destiny’s Child.”",
  "“ET” is also reporting that 2014 halftime headliner Bruno Mars will also join the band during a portion of the performance.",
  "The Super Bowl will take place on February 7."
