  "Stand down, Beyhive.",
  "That “new, secret” Beyonce album everyone has been buzzing about is apparently not so much.  It was announced on Tuesday that a “Beyonce Platinum Edition Box Set” will be released November 24.",
  "The two-CD, two-DVD deluxe version of her latest album isn’t what fans had been anticipating.",
  "Rumors mounted after a picture of a track list circulated online, showing collaborations with Rihanna, Justin Timberlake and Nicki Minaj. But the list turned out not to be credible.",
  "Hope sprung even further after Amazon seemed to confirm that something was happening when its UK site posted a  product page for “Beyonce Vol. 2,” a four-disc import, to be released November 24.",
  "But alas, the new box set will be a repackaging of her current album and a six-song CD called “More,” which will include new songs “7/11” and “Ring Off” and remixes of existing songs featuring artists like her husband, Jay Z, Minaj and Kanye West.",
  "Here is what else the set will contain, according to Columbia Records and Beyonce’s company, Parkwood Entertainment:",
  "• “Live” DVD featuring 10 live performances from the Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, with artist commentary and an accompanying photo booklet",
  "• “Beyonce” original audio CD, featuring 14 songs and accompanying photo booklet",
  "• “Beyonce” original DVD, featuring 17 music videos",
  "• The official 2015 Beyonce mini calendar",
  "The singer surprised fans last year when she unexpectedly released her self-titled, straight-to-iTunes album."
