  "When it rains Beyonce it pours Beyonce.",
  "One day before taking the stage with Coldplay at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, the singer dropped her first new single since 2014.",
  "“Formation” is available to stream and download free, exclusively through Tidal. Set against the backdrop of New Orleans, the video includes references to Hurricane Katrina, Creole culture and police brutality – with a large dose of hot sauce. Her daughter, Blue Ivy, has a cameo.",
  "Fans suspected something was in the works given how quiet Beyonce has been leading up to the halftime show. As one might imagine, they are extremely pleased with the news."
