  "(CNN) – For years, doctors around the country taking an exam to become board certified in radiology have cheated by memorizing test questions, creating sophisticated banks of what are known as “recalls,” a CNN investigation has found.",
  "The recall exams are meticulously compiled by radiology residents, who write down the questions after taking the test, in radiology programs around the country, including some of the most prestigious programs in the U.S.",
  "“It’s been going on a long time, I know, but I can’t give you a date,” said Dr. Gary Becker, executive director of the American Board of Radiology (ABR), which oversees the exam that certifies radiologists.",
  "Asked if this were considered cheating, Becker told CNN, “We would call it cheating, and our exam security policy would call it cheating, yes.”",

Dozens of radiology residents interviewed by CNN said that they promised before taking the written test to memorize certain questions and write them down immediately after the test along with fellow residents.",
