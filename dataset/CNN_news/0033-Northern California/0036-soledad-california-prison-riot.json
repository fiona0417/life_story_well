  "Eight inmates were hospitalized Wednesday after a riot at a Northern California prison, corrections officials said.",
  "Approximately 50 more inmates were being treated for minor injuries by the prison medical staff, officials said.",
  "The incident occurred shortly after 11 a.m. when approximately 200 inmates began fighting in the recreation yard of the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, located south of San Jose, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a press release.",
  "When the inmates did not comply with the staffâ€™s orders, authorities deployed chemical agents and non-lethal weapons. Staff members also fired nine rounds of warning shots to end the incident, corrections officials said.",
  "But the warning shots only stopped one group of inmates.",
  "The second group initially refused to follow orders and lie on the ground. Approximately 12 minutes later, the prisoners complied when more staff members from CTF and correctional staff from nearby Salinas Valley State Prison arrived, corrections officials said.",
  "The eight hospitalized inmates suffered injuries including puncture wounds, cuts and bruises to head, neck and torso areas, the corrections department said. They are in stable condition.",
  "No prison staff members were injured during the riot."
