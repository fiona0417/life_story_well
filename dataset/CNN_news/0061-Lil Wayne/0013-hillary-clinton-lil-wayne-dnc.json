  "Hillary Clinton delivered a historic speech Thursday night, capping off a bruising primary and becoming the first female presidential nominee of a major US party.",
  "Taking note of this significant point in the country’s history, Clinton said: “When there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit.”",
  "This line seemed fitting, but the phrases “no ceilings” and “sky’s the limit” stopped some hip-hop fans dead in their tracks. Both of those phrases conjure Lil Wayne, one of the most prolific rappers of his generation, who in the late 2000s released a mixtape named “No Ceilings” and had a song off his acclaimed “Da Drought” mixtape series named “The Sky’s the Limit.”",
  "It’s a serious stretch, but that didn’t stop people from having fun celebrating the self-proclaimed “greatest rapper alive.”"
