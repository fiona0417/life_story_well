  "Wednesday is the best day of the week because that’s when the new books arrive in stores. Here are some of the comics scheduled to hit the shelves on October 5, 2011. Your local retailer will probably have these and others, so make sure to check with them for more details.",
  "As someone who isn’t reading a lot of Marvel titles, I thought I should jump into the fray and check out AVENGERS 1959 #1. With all the hype from the movie and knowing the Avengers are a classic Marvel title, I’m looking forward to this five-comic miniseries.",
  "What comics are you looking forward to this week? Is there a comic out there you are really loving? If so let us know in the comments. We’re always looking for tips on good comics!",
