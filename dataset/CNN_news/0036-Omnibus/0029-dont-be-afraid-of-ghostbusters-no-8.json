  "Hello again, fellow comic readers!",
  "There is no doubt who you’re gonna call for this week’s pick, IDW’s new “Ghostbusters” comic!",
  "I am a huge fan of the movie and the first couple seasons of the cartoon, “The Real Ghostbusters.” Until now, I never read the comics for fear of ruining my memories of the franchise.",
  "Our brilliant Geek Out friend Daniel Dean from Titan Games and Comics in Smyrna, Georgia, was of the same mindset when we saw the preview for this series.",
  "“I was super stoked when this new series was announced because I’ve been following penciler Dan Schoening for years online,” he said.",
  "“Ghostbusters”  No. 8, out today, is a standalone issue, or one-shot as they call it in the comic book industry. The next issue will kick off a new four-issue story arc, so this is a perfect jumping-on point for new readers.",
  "If you missed the initial issues like I did, you can catch up with the latest paperback – it’s a great story. This book has everything I love about the movie – hell, the franchise as a whole.",
  "Writers Erik Burnham and Tristan Jones, who wrote an additional – and actually, pretty good – short Ghostbusters story at the end of the book, wrote a beautiful marriage of fan-friendly nods and interesting access points for newcomers to the comic or franchise. The writers even found the time to explore some really grim, more mature ideas than a comedy or cartoon show would usually handle.",
  "The eighth issue alone has all this. Believe me, you want to get in on it before the next big story begins.",
  "Remember, when you’re asked if you’re going to pick up IDW’s “Ghostbusters No. 8” this week, “You say ‘YES!’”",
  "So, until next week, go forth and read, my people. And the reading will be good!",
  "Is there a comic out there that you really love? Let us know in the comments. We’re always looking for tips on good comics!",
  "Here are some of the comics scheduled to hit the shelves on Wednesday. Your local retailer will probably have these and others, so make sure to check with them for more details.",
