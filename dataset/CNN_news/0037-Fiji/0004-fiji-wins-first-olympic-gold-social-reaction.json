  "If ever a team ignited the spirit of celebration, it’s Fiji. After the Pacific island nation crushed Great Britain in rugby sevens, securing a majestic 43-7 win, thousands turned out in the streets, at schools and even in shops to celebrate the momentous win.",
  "Naturally, social media pulled up a seat at the party.  Captured on Twitter and Instagram, streets across Suva city center were a riot of sound and color.",
  "As the deputy editor-in-chief of the Fiji Times, Elenoa Baselaia, told CNN, “Rugby is like a religion in Fiji, and we’re already a very religious country.”  So it’s not surprising that the hashtag #TosoViti, meaning ‘life is good,’  was tweeted over 2,500 times after the win. Ecstatic moments were captured as fans stood roadside to cheer and wave, and students clustered around their teacher’s cellphone to watch the moment of victory.",
  "In an unusual twist, Fiji’s victory came thanks in part to a Brit. Englishman Ben Ryan has coached the team for three years and is known for instilling discipline into his team’s outrageously talented players. In fact, many credit coach Ryan for steering the winners to victory. He offered a grateful message of thanks.",
  "The Fiji team was already the firm favorite to win the rugby sevens, so it looked like the “mystic approach”  he credits the team with having, paid off handsomely.",
  "Celebrations were held in all quarters. The French embassy in Fiji joined up with the Filipino police force to back their beloved team.  They must have sensed a momentous occasion in the air.",
  "The Fiji Netball team was eager to celebrate history-in-the-making by sharing this note posted by shopkeepers.",
  "Wonder if the shopkeeper made it back in time to open up?"
