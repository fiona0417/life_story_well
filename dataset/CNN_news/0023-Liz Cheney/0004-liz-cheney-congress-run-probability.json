  "Former Vice President Dick Cheney’s daughter, Liz, is leaning toward another bid for Congress, sources close to the Cheneys say.",
  "There will be an open seat in the House from Wyoming in the next election, and Liz Cheney is likely to make a bid for it, according to those sources.",
  "Cheney herself says she is “seriously considering running and will make a final decision in the next couple of weeks.”",
  "A final decision, however, has not been made.",
  "The consideration comes one day after Rep. Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, announced she would not run for reelection for her seat, Wyoming’s sole member of the House of Representatives, next year.",
  "Cheney challenged a sitting Republican in a tough primary for his Senate seat in 2014, shortly after moving her family from Washington, D.C., to Wyoming. As she was trailing in the polls, Cheney withdrew from the race citing a health issue concerning one of her five children.",
  "Since then, she has continued to be a political presence in Wyoming and maintained her public profile with a book deal and contributing on Fox News.",
  "Cheney is discussing the bid with family and political supporters.",
