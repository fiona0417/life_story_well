  "The House Republican Conference voted Wednesday morning to oust Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney as GOP conference chair. It’s a dramatic turnaround for the conservative congresswoman, who was elected to the position less than three years ago at the encouragement of Republican leadership.",
  "Despite Cheney voting in line with former President Donald Trump’s agenda 92.9% of the time, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has said he supports replacing her with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. After the January 6 insurrection, Cheney voted to impeach Trump while Stefanik voted against. The events of the past few months stand in stark contrast to Cheney’s decades-long career where she served the GOP in roles that ranged from the Department of State to guest hosting on Fox News."
