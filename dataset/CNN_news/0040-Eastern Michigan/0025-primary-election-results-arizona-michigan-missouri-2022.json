  "Here are some key takeaways so far from Tuesday's primaries:",
  "Kansas maintains constitutional right to abortion: Kansas voters sent a dramatic message on Tuesday, opting to maintain the right to an abortion in their state's constitution just weeks after the US Supreme Court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade. Polls have long shown that voters overwhelmingly support protecting abortions rights. But the win for the \"no\" vote in Kansas is proof of that and signals that the Supreme Court decision has further angered voters and possibly shifted the politics of the issue ahead of the November elections. The \"no\" leaves the state constitution unchanged. While lawmakers in the state can still try to pass restrictive abortion laws, courts in Kansas have recognized a right to abortion under the state constitution. The biggest warning to Republicans, many of whom have trumpeted the overturning of Roe and backed pushes to pass stricter abortions laws, is perhaps the turnout in Kansas. With 78% of the vote in on Tuesday night, nearly 700,000 people have cast ballots in the primary, a figure that already dwarfs the turnout in the 2020 presidential primary election.Greitens' attempted comeback falls flat: Republicans in Missouri breathed a sigh of relief after state Attorney General Eric Schmitt won the wide-open Senate primary, according to a CNN projection. Perhaps more significant than who won, though, in the deep-red state, is who lost: disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who was attempting a political comeback. Greitens resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusation of campaign misconduct, and subsequently faced abuse allegations from his ex-wife, which he has denied. Schmitt, the attorney general, emerged from a crowded field that included two members of Congress, Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long. Former President Donald Trump stayed out of the race, issuing a tongue-in-cheek statement supporting \"Eric\" on the eve of the primary — leaving it up to voters' interpretation whether that meant Schmitt or Greitens.A member of the \"impeachment 10\" is defeated: Rep. Peter Meijer became the second of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump to be ousted in a primary Tuesday, losing to Trump-endorsed conservative challenger John Gibbs, CNN projected. Democrats played a role in boosting Gibbs — a calculated decision that has become a flashpoint, angering some Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans. Meijer, a freshman, voted to impeach Trump just days after taking office, after the insurrection of January 6, 2021. Gibbs, meanwhile, backed Trump's lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Meijer's loss means the Grand Rapids-based 3rd District seat will be one of the most competitive House contests in November's midterm elections.Unknowns in Arizona: Arizona's race for the Republican nomination for governor could depend on whether former President Donald Trump's supporters turned out in force on election day in a state that conducts its contests largely by mail. Karrin Taylor Robson, a former member of the Arizona Board of Regents who is backed by former Vice President Mike Pence and outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey, led former television journalist Kari Lake, a Trump-endorsed election denier, in the early returns Wednesday morning. But the early results were largely mail-in ballots. Votes cast on election day were expected to favor Lake — a result of Trump's years-long effort to undermine faith in mail-in voting. The Arizona gubernatorial primary was the most significant contest in a set of primaries that tested Trump's influence over the GOP.Dixon casts Michigan governor's race as referendum on Covid policies: Tudor Dixon, the conservative commentator endorsed by Trump in the final days of the race and backed by large factions of the Michigan Republican establishment, won the state's GOP primary to take on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, CNN projected. The clash in Michigan could be one of the nation's most competitive governor's races. Whitmer has cast herself as a bulwark for abortion rights in a state where Republicans have sought to enforce a 1931 law that would impose a near-total ban on abortion. Dixon, meanwhile, framed the race in her victory speech Tuesday night as a referendum on restrictions Whitmer imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Dixon, a mother of four who is backed by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's family, is also an advocate of school choice — potentially positioning education as a marquee issue in November's midterm election.Progressives suffer another defeat in Michigan: Rep. Haley Stevens' projected Democratic primary victory in Michigan's newly drawn 11th Congressional District over fellow Rep. Andy Levin marks another blow against progressives in what has been a mostly disappointing primary season. It's also a resounding victory for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and its super PAC, United Democracy Project, which has spent millions backing moderate, more staunchly pro-Israel candidates in Democratic primaries. Stevens and Levin are both supportive of Israel, but Levin — who is Jewish — has been more willing to criticize its government's treatment of Palestinians and is the lead sponsor of the Two-State Solution Act.",

  "12:12 a.m. ET, August 3, 2022, Biden praises Kansas vote to maintain right to abortion in state constitution, From CNN's Brian Rokus in Washington, DC",
  "President Biden released a statement on tonight’s vote in Kansas maintaining the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution.",
  "“This vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions. Congress should listen to the will of the American people and restore the protections of Roe as federal law,” Biden said in the statement.",
  "“The Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade put women’s health and lives at risk. Tonight, the American people had something to say about it,” it adds.",
  "Kansas voters voted “no” on a proposed constitutional amendment, according to a CNN projection.",
  "More background: The vote comes after a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling found the state constitution does protect the right to an abortion. A “yes” vote on the amendment would have removed the right to abortion from the state constitution and allowed GOP lawmakers to pass further restriction or a ban on abortion, while a “no” vote maintains it.",
  "Polls have consistently shown that the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is broadly unpopular. A CNN poll released in late July found nearly two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court decision, with even 55% of self-identified moderate or liberal Republicans saying they disapproved of the decision. But the results on Tuesday, the first electoral test of abortion rights after the Supreme Court decision, put an even finer point on that sentiment.",

  "Kobach has prioritized issues such as border control and was the general counsel and board member for a private border wall project that was at the center of a fraud investigation in 2020.",
